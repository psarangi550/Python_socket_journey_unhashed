#### **<u>Multi Processing</u>**

- executing multiple task where each task is separate independent process is known as as process based nultitasking or multi processing

- here one process is independent of another process

- operating system required task are mostly multi processing task where each task have separate independent process and no dependecy between one process to another process

- multiple process will be there in the case of multiprocessing  

#### **<u>Multi Threading </u>**

- exexuting multiple task where each individual tag is a separate independent part or process of the same program then its called as the thread based multitasking or multi threading 

- only 1 process will be there in the case of the multi threading 

- but here each task or program inside the process is a separate independent process 

- thread is nothing but the independent flow or program which run inside a single process

- a thread is a flow of execution

- we can go for multithreading if there is no dependent thread i.e one thread mustn't depend on another thread 

- python provide threading module to support the threading programs

- each individual independent task is a thread jobs and once thread executed its job it will be terminated
